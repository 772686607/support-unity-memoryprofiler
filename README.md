# Support-Unity Memory Profiler Extension
Extension for the existing Unity memory profiler project, this is a WIP project which uses as a base the Memory Profiler project found in https://bitbucket.org/Unity-Technologies/memoryprofiler and uses the new memory profiler API introduced in Unity5.3a4, adding filters and search options with a node viewer for the objects and their references.

* Requires Unity 5.6 
* Requires a IL2CPP build
* It uses the same snapshots taken with the Memory Profiler project from bitbucket (You can use an example memory snapshot which is included in the repository)
